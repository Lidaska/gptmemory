Hey if you reading this, it's probably because i want you to help with my exam. This is computer graphics question bank, and please keep the answers a bit short unless i ask you to explain in brief. If i memorize information, i can expand it on myself, but if you give expanded it's hard to memorize. Btw computer graphics also has a practical exam, that's probably gonna be a headache but let's work on theory rn. :D My name's Adil, and rn sem III 2nd year bsc in AI.
